ERRORS

One of the biggest troubles we had with this program werethe ; connectors.  We encounter many complier errors withthe ; connectors.  This is because the ; connectors do not need to be separated by a space from the command.  Oncewe understood how the ; connectors were storedin the 2 dimensional array we were able to resolve the problem.

The other connectors such as the || and && also gave us errors but they were not as difficult as the ; connector erros.

We had difficult with running the execute functions as itwas not working properly with the process methods.  This was mainly because we were unfamiliar with the process methods.
